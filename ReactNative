https://nodejs.org/en/

Open your terminal and install expo 
npm install expo-cli --global

Make a new directory, once in the directory make a new project
expo init <name>

It will ask you what template you want. Select blank: minimal dependencies 
once everything loads change into the directory:
cd <name>

Once in the directory run the following command
expo start

It will open a webpage. Assuming you have the expo app you can just scan the QR code. No need to sign up.
Also if you are ON CAMPUS switch the connection to tunnel. You'll get issues if you try to use the LAN connection.
